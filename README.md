# Hueman 7L Wordpress Child Theme

Authored by Felix Wolfsteller, Copyright 2016, 2017, released under the GPLv3+.

i18n work by GÃ¶tz Hendrik Wiegand.

Works together with custom wordpress plugin [ev7l-events](https://github.com/ecovillage/ev7l-events) .

The original and awesome Presscustomizr hueman theme source can also be [found at github](https://github.com/presscustomizr/hueman).

### parts/post-list-author-date.php

Overwritten from vanilla hueman (3.3.4) - do not display author and date in 'betrieb' archive view.

### content.php

Overwritten from vanilla hueman (3.3.4) - do not category if about in a 'betrieb' post (over)view.


### style.css

Main css overrides and new definitions.

### functions.php

Enough emptiness for everybody.  Now, things start to happen here.

### parts/registration.php

Registration form, mailer and logic, integrated into legacy system.

## About registrations

Will be put in pseudo-randomly named files (for legacy database, json import) in the `registrations` subdirectory of your wordpress home base.  You should put a `.htaccess` file there and instruct your webserver to not let anybody come close to that data.

##### [featured_news]

Shows a flexslider running through latest posts of the 'news' category.

##### [upcoming_events]

Shows an 'alx' style list of upcoming events, much like in the sidebar widget of the ev7l-events plugin.

##### [pages_list]

Shows child pages of a certain page as in the two-column post list.
Example: `[pages_list parent_name="My Parent Page Title"]`
